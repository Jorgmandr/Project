# Project
This repository contains my projects as an undergraduate student.
This contains a Data Analysis Project for Watershed Management. It was a part of a non-credit specialization of  on Coursera on the topic of Excel to MySQL: Analytic Techniques for Business.
Watershed Management is a fictional company who are in the long term rental market. They are exploring the possibility of entering the short-term rental markets, similar to Airbnb, FlipKey or VRBO. 
It was my responsibility to clean and analyse the datasets provided to me and by them and use a mix of MS-Excel, Tableau and MySQL for making a business recommendation.
