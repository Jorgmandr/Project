# Project - 2
This contains a Data Analysis Project based on the HADS (Housing Affordability Data System provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Department. 
The HADS are a set of files derived from the 1985, and later American Housing Survey (AHS) and the 2002 and later Metro AHS.
The datasets provided were cleaned and analysed thoroughly. After cleaning a multitude of stastical tests were used including Linear Regression, Log-Log and Semi-Log analysis. Later 'Holdout Analysis' for testing prediction of the best-fitting model.
